# Booking-deprecated
My old booking plugin for WordPress. Created last year for company.

On 6th December 2019 I was working on a plug-in to extend WordPress with a hairdressing salon for dogs and cats. I decided to use @nhn/tui.calendar, by the way I had to add the ability to sync via Google Calendar, log in with social media, full integration with WordPress users and download offer details from WordPress Custom Posts.

Today, March 25th, 2020, the project is abandoned. I don't know under what license to publish it, the code was written by me, libraries are on MIT but it was supposed to be created for someone else. Until it is clear, I insert the code as an example.
